This program tests for proper interrupt-driven operation of the LPT1
parallel printer port.  Although DOS is not terribly fussy about
papallel printing, certain printer spoolers (including the OS/2
spooler) depend on interrupts for efficient operation.

To run this test you must have a printer ready and connected to the
first parallel port, and be sure to boot the system without ANY TSR's
installed!  The test messages are self-explanatory.  If the test is
passed perfectly, the following message is displayed:

Test completed successfully.

[Note: run this program under native DOS, e.g. DOS booted from a floppy
disk.]
